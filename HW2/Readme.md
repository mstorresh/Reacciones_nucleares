This HW is about a elastic scattering with m_p>m_t, in this excercise is a plot of a scattering with \lambda = 2, that means m_p/m_t = 2.

For running the code you have to writte make in the Linux or Macos console.

If you want to run again the code, first you need to run make clean and after that you can run make again.

# Requirements:

* Have installed MAkefile, c++, gnuplot, okular
